Streamlit Application with Elasticsearch Integration
Description:
This is a Streamlit application that integrates Elasticsearch for data retrieval and manipulation. The application utilizes the Elasticsearch Python client (elasticsearch) to interact with an Elasticsearch instance, spacy for natural language processing, and pandas for data manipulation. It also utilizes scikit-learn for computing cosine similarity.

Setup Instructions:
Install Dependencies:

Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
Install the required Python packages using pip:
bash
Copy code
pip install streamlit pandas elasticsearch spacy scikit-learn==0.24.2
Elasticsearch Setup:

Ensure Elasticsearch is installed and running on your system or accessible via a URL.
The Elasticsearch Python client version 7.13.4 is required for this application. You can install it using:
bash
Copy code
pip install elasticsearch==7.13.4
Download SpaCy Model:

Download the SpaCy English model by running:
bash
Copy code
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
Running the Application:
Start the Streamlit Server:

Navigate to the directory containing your Python script.
Run the Streamlit application using the following command:
bash
Copy code
streamlit run your_script.py
Replace your_script.py with the filename of your Streamlit application script.

Interacting with the Application:

Once the Streamlit server is running, you can access the application in your web browser.
Follow the instructions provided in the Streamlit interface to interact with the Elasticsearch data, perform natural language processing tasks, and compute cosine similarity.
Notes:
Ensure that your Elasticsearch instance is properly configured and accessible from the application.
This application assumes familiarity with Elasticsearch, Streamlit, and basic natural language processing concepts.
